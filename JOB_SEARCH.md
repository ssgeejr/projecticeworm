## üß≠ Phase 1: Job Targeting & Resume Customization

### Step 1: Find a Job Listing

Use [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com) or [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com) and search for jobs like:

* Junior DevOps Engineer
* Cloud Support Technician
* IT Support Specialist
* Site Reliability Associate
* Linux Administrator (Entry-Level)

**Filter for:**

* \$18‚Äì\$25/hr or \~\$2,000+/month
* Remote or hybrid roles
* Keywords in the description like: *AWS, Docker, GitHub, CI/CD, Terraform, Jenkins, Linux*

### Step 2: Upload Job Description and Resume to ChatGPT

Say the following:

```
I found a job I want to apply for. I'm uploading the job description and my current resume (in Word format). Please create a tailored, ATS-friendly version of my resume that aligns with this job. Use industry-appropriate language and terminology that a senior DevOps engineer or hiring manager would expect. Ensure it includes technical and soft skills relevant to the role.
```

### ChatGPT Will Ask You:

* What is your most recent or relevant job title?
* Should I include all work history or just the most relevant years?
* Which technologies or tools are you strongest with?
* Do you want to highlight soft skills (collaboration, communication, initiative)?
* Do you have any employment gaps I should address or smooth over?

Answer honestly and clearly.

## üé§ Phase 2: Interview Preparation

### Step 1: Request Interview Questions

Say:

```
Now generate 20 realistic interview questions based on the job description. Use phrasing a senior engineer or hiring manager would use.
```

ChatGPT will return a set of **targeted, role-specific questions**. Save them as a PDF.

### Step 2: Request Ideal Answers

Say:

```
Now provide detailed, confident answers to each of the 20 questions as if I were the candidate. Format them into a second PDF.
```

Save this second PDF. Read and practice the answers aloud.

## üíª Phase 3: GitHub Project for Skill Growth

Say to ChatGPT:

```
Based on this job description, please design a 3-day GitHub project that will expose me to the tools, workflows, and concepts expected in this role. Include:
- A README file with instructions
- 3 days of learning milestones
- Code that could be added to my portfolio
```

ChatGPT will propose a mini-project like:

* Deploy a simple app using AWS EC2 + Docker
* Create a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
* Monitor system logs and visualize them with Prometheus + Grafana

Follow the guide, ask for help if needed, and complete the project.
